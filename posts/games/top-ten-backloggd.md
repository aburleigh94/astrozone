For the past several years, I've enjoyed listening to video game podcasts such as [Giant Bomb](https://giantbomb.com/), [Nextlander](https://www.patreon.com/cw/nextlander), [Remap Radio](https://remapradio.com/), and [MinnMax](https://minnmax.com/). One of the traditions for these outlets at the end of each year is ranking their top ten games that were released that year, and I've enjoyed ranking my own top ten lists as the year unfolds. Previously, I had maintained these lists on each iteration of my personal site and my intention was to write blog posts every year. Unfortunately, I haven't actually found the motivation to write these posts. I've decided instead to manage all my Top Ten Game lists through [Backloggd](https://backloggd.com/), a Letterboxd-like site that helps users track and organize the video games they have been playing. I'm already using this site to track the games I'm currently playing as well as the upcoming games I want to play in the future, so it made sense to do all my game tracking in one place. If you're curious about what games I'm playing or want to follow me on Backloggd, here's a link to [my profile](https://backloggd.com/u/ScrubbyMcdub/), which includes the lists of my favorite games dating back to 2018.
